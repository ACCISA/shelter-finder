# Shelter-Finder

This is a project about helping homeless people to find a shelter quickly and efficiently. Developed during the very cold Canadian
winter in Montr√©al, we took inspiration from our spirit of community. Helping everyone is our moto for this project, and we hope 
it will contribute greatly towards that goal.
